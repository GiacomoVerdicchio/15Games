# 15 game
### The puzzle game that was part of my childhood
When some time ago I was looking at my toys I saw the puzzle that I used to do when I was a kid, "15 game", in a box. After some time, when I was completing some microsoft Awards, I saw that Microsoft built in a 
digital way one of my favorites game. So I decided to do it by myself first to continue practing with JavaFx and also to costumize the puzzle in my own manner.

Work In Progres:
-still have to solve the issue of the dimensions of the rectangol for 4x4 shape
-still have to add to each piece a dynamically chosen and adapted image

Project Duration (till now): 20 hours
